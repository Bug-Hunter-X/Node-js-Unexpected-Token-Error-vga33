# Node.js Unexpected Token Error

This repository demonstrates a Node.js bug that leads to an unexpected token error when using the `require` statement. The error is caused by a syntax error in the required module, highlighting the importance of maintaining accurate syntax in all parts of your Node.js project.

## Bug Description
